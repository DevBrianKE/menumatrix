# MenuMatrix CLI Application

## Overview

**MenuMatrix** is a Python-based Command Line Interface (CLI) application built using SQLAlchemy and Alembic to manage a restaurant's menu system. This application allows users to interact with the menu, place orders, and manage menu items through a simple terminal interface. The project showcases a modular design, persistence through SQLAlchemy, and migration management with Alembic.

---

## Learning Goals

- Implement a modular CLI application in Python
- Utilize SQLAlchemy ORM for data persistence
- Handle database migrations with Alembic
- Follow separation of concerns and code organization best practices

## How to Run the App

### Install dependencies

1. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following commands:

```bash
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

### Run the database migrations

2. Apply any database migrations to ensure your database schema is up-to-date:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### Start the CLI

3. Run the CLI application:

```bash
python lib/cli.py
```

---

## Features

- **View menu items**: See all available menu items.
- **Add new menu items**: Add new items to the menu.
- **Place new orders**: Place orders by selecting menu items.
- **View existing orders**: View the details of past orders.
- **Delete menu items or orders**: Remove menu items or orders from the system.

## Key Files and Their Roles

### `lib/cli.py`

This is the main entry point of the application. It contains the `main()` loop that displays the CLI menu and routes user input to relevant helper functions.

```python
def main():
    while True:
        menu()
        choice = input("> ")
        if choice == "0":
            exit_program()
        elif choice == "1":
            view_menu()
        ...
```

### `lib/helpers.py`

This file contains the helper functions used by the CLI. These functions implement the logic for viewing the menu, adding items, placing orders, etc.

```python
def view_menu():
    items = session.query(MenuItem).all()
    for item in items:
        print(item)
```

### `lib/models/models.py`

This file defines the SQLAlchemy models used for data persistence, such as `MenuItem`, `Order`, and other database entities.

```python
class MenuItem(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'menu_items'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    price = Column(Float)
    ...
```

### `lib/db/session.py`

This file creates and exposes the SQLAlchemy session, which is used for interacting with the database across the application.

---

## Migrations with Alembic

### How to make database schema changes

1. **Modify the models** in `models.py` to reflect the desired schema changes.

2. **Generate a migration** with Alembic:

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add new field to MenuItem"
```

3. **Apply the migration** to update the database schema:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```
